            //  route A, B's view is presented modally.
            //  4. User peforms interaction that sends action `dismissCurrentNavigator(andThen: .navigate(to: .C))`
            //  5. Modal is dismissed and the intermediate navigation state points to .A
            //  6. Because the intermidiate navigation state's navigator is equal to the navigator associated 
            //  with C's view and both A and C view have a .stack root component, C's view is pushed into the
            //  navigation stack.
            //

            //
            //  A -> B

    // a modal view controller. The reason being that view controller transition are usually animated and UIKit
    // provides a callback block that gets executed once the transition was completed.
    //
    // Because message processing must be sequential, we cannot process messages while executing a view controller
    // transition because that could result in inconsistent application state or miss-rendering issues. Also there
    // are some actions exposed by Portal, like `.dismissNavigator(thenSend: Action<MessageType, RouteType>)` that
    // are designed to be executed atomically; meaning that immediatly after the navigator (view controller) has been
    // dismissed the action indicated by `thenSend` associated value should be dispatched, without processing any other
    // messages that could be waiting in the processing queue.
    //
    // A typical example where rendering issues could happen if transition are not handled properly could be when the
    // user wants to dismiss a modal view controller and push a detail view in the navigation stack of the view
    // controller that presented the modal view controller in the first place. Presenting the detail view should
    // happen right after the modal view controller is dismissed. The problem could arise if message are being
    // dispatched while the modal dismissal transition and the detail view controller transition is being performed.
    //
    // This messages could be dispatched by asincronous processes or a subscription. To avoid loosing message and
    // mantain arraival ordering, because message are processed sequentially in separate queue (or thread) and view
    // controller transitions are executed on the main thread; Portal needs to suspend execution of messages in the
    // processing queue, then tell UIKit (or any other view layer) to execute the transition and once the transition is
    // completed resume processing message.
    //
    // In cases where transitions need to dispatch a message right after the transition has completed, like with
    // `.dismissNavigator(thenSend: Action<MessageType, RouteType>)`, we need to guarantee that the `thenSend` action
    // will be executed right away, no matter if there are pending messages in the queue. In other words, the `thenSend`
    // action has higher priority that any other message in the operation queue waiting to be processed.
    //
    // This methods wraps the transition in a function that receives a transition completion callback and when called
    // suspends the message processing queue, executes the transition and once the transition is completed enqueues
    // the received transition completion callback to be executed with the highest priority and resumes the
    // message processing queue.
